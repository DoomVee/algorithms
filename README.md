# Algorithms & Data Structures
## Java
Here you can find the Java Boilerplate. The main language of the tutorial will
be TypeScript, but if you feel comfortable enough with Java, then feel free
to use this boilerplate in order to get started with this.  

This Branch is set up in a way, so that you can code along with the TypeScript
tutorial and includes a location for your source code 
(`src/main/java/org/doomvee/ands/`) and a place for your Unit Tests
(`src/test/java/org/doomvee/ands/`) as per Maven Standards!  

Have fun! For questions, feel free to use the original repositories Discussion
