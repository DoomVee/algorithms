# Algorithms & Data Structures
This is the repository for the Algorithms & Data Structures Discord Course.
You can attend the lectures in the 
[Programmer's Palace Discord Server](http://www.programmerspalace.com/).

## Repository Structure
I will maintain several branches (see the dropdown button in the top left of
the committed files) for different purposes. The `master`-branch will be the
most up-to-date working solution to the material we will definitely cover in
the lecture.  
The other branches will provide things like boilerplates, the current progress
and potentially other solutions or solutions in other programming languages.
