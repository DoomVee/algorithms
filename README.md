# Algorithms & Data Structures
## TypeScript / JavaScript

Here you can find the TypeScript boilerplate. This Branch is set up in a way, 
so that you can code along with the lecture. The source code will go into
`src/{topic}/{subtopic}.ts` and the tests will go into a similar directory
structure: `test/{topic}/{subtopic}.spec.ts`.  

Have fun! For questions, feel free to use the original repositories
